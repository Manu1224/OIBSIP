               <li>&#8658;
                Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on  2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948 was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from British rule. 
               </li>
               
               <li>&#8658;
                Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, Gandhi trained in the law at the Inner Temple, London, and was called to the bar at age 22 in June 1891.
               </li>
               
               <li>&#8658;
                After two uncertain years in India, where he was unable to start a successful law practice, he moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit. He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. It was here that Gandhi raised a family and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. 
               </li>
               
               <li>&#8658;
                In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India and soon set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination.
               </li>
               
               <li>&#8658;
                Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending untouchability, and, above all, achieving swaraj or self-rule. Gandhi adopted the short dhoti woven with hand-spun yarn as a mark of identification with India's rural poor.

            <h3><u>Early life and background</u></h3>
        
           <p>&#8658;<b>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi</b>was born on 2 October 1869 into a Gujarati Hindu Modh Bania family in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porbandar">Porbandar</a> (also known as Sudamapuri), a coastal town on the Kathiawar Peninsula and then part of the small princely state of Porbandar in the Kathiawar Agency of the British Raj.</p>
           <p>&#8658;His father, <b>Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi</b> (1822–1885), served as the dewan (chief minister) of Porbandar state.His family originated from the then village of Kutiana in what was then Junagadh State.</p>
           <ul>
            <li>Although he only had an elementary education and had previously been a clerk in the state administration, Karamchand proved a capable chief minister</li>
            <li>During his tenure, he married four times. His first two wives died young, after each had given birth to a daughter, and his third marriage was childless. </li>
            <li>In 1857, he sought his third wife's permission to remarry; that year, he married Putlibai (1844–1891), who also came from Junagadh,and was from a Pranami Vaishnava family.</li>
            <li>On 2 October 1869, Putlibai gave birth to her last child, Mohandas, in a dark, windowless ground-floor room of the Gandhi family residence in Porbandar city. As a child, Gandhi was described by his sister Raliat as "restless as mercury, either playing or roaming about. One of his favourite pastimes was twisting dogs' ears.</li>
          </ul>
         <h4>&#10132; He was an average student, won some prizes, but was a shy and tongue tied student, with no interest in games; his only companions were books and school lessons</h4>
        <h4>&#10132;In May 1883, the 13-year-old Mohandas was married to 14-year-old Kasturbai Makhanji Kapadia (her first name was usually shortened to "Kasturba", and affectionately to "Ba") in an arranged marriage, according to the custom of the region at that time.</h4>

            <p>Gandhi had dropped out of the cheapest college he could afford in Bombay. Mavji Dave Joshiji, a Brahmin priest and family friend, advised Gandhi and his family that he should consider law studies in London.<br>
                In July 1888, his wife Kasturba gave birth to their first surviving son, Harilal. His mother was not comfortable about Gandhi leaving his wife and family, and going so far from home. Gandhi's uncle Tulsidas also tried to dissuade his nephew. Gandhi wanted to go. To persuade his wife and mother, Gandhi made a vow in front of his mother that he would abstain from meat, alcohol and women. Gandhi's brother Laxmidas, who was already a lawyer, cheered Gandhi's London studies plan and offered to support him. Putlibai gave Gandhi her permission and blessing.<br>
                On 10 August 1888, Gandhi aged 18, left Porbandar for Mumbai, then known as Bombay. Upon arrival, he stayed with the local Modh Bania community whose elders warned him that England would tempt him to compromise his religion, and eat and drink in Western ways. Despite Gandhi informing them of his promise to his mother and her blessings, he was excommunicated from his caste. Gandhi ignored this, and on 4 September, he sailed from Bombay to London, with his brother seeing him off. Gandhi attended University College, London, where he took classes in English literature with Henry Morley in 1888–1889.</p>
        
        
         <h4>&#10140;<u>Civil rights activist in <b>South Africa (1893–1914)</u></b></h4>
         
         
         <p>&#10140;In April 1893, Gandhi aged 23, set sail for South Africa to be the lawyer for Abdullah's cousin.[49][50] He spent 21 years in South Africa, where he developed his political views, ethics and politics.</p>

         <p>&#10140;Immediately upon arriving in South Africa, Gandhi faced discrimination because of his skin colour and heritage. [53] He was not allowed to sit with European passengers in the stagecoach and told to sit on the floor near the driver, then beaten when he refused; elsewhere he was kicked into a gutter for daring to walk near a house, in another instance t</p>
         
         <p>&#10140; He sat in the train station, shivering all night and pondering if he should return to India or protest for his rights.[54] He chose to protest and was allowed to board the train the next day.In another incident, the magistrate of a Durban court ordered Gandhi to remove his turban, which he refused to do. Indians were not allowed to walk on public footpaths in South Africa. Gandhi was kicked by a police officer out of the footpath onto the street without warning.</p>
         <p>&#10140; When Gandhi arrived in South Africa, according to Herman, he thought of himself as "a Briton first, and an Indian second". However, the prejudice against him and his fellow Indians from British people that Gandhi experienced and observed deeply bothered him. He found it humiliating, struggling to understand how some people can feel honour or superiority or pleasure in such inhumane practices. Gandhi began to question his people's standing in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire">British Empire</a></p>

            <h3><u>Struggle for Indian independence (1915–1947)</u></h3>
            <p>At the request of Gopal Krishna Gokhale, conveyed to him by C. F. Andrews, Gandhi returned to India in 1915. He brought an international reputation as a leading Indian nationalist, theorist and community organiser..</p>
            <p>Gandhi joined the Indian National Congress and was introduced to Indian issues, politics and the Indian people primarily by Gokhale. Gokhale was a key leader of the Congress Party best known for his restraint and moderation, and his insistence on working inside the system. Gandhi took Gokhale's liberal approach based on British Whiggish traditions and transformed it to make it look Indian.</p>
            <p>Gandhi took leadership of the Congress in 1920 and began escalating demands until on 26 January 1930 the Indian National Congress declared the independence of India. The British did not recognise the declaration but negotiations ensued, with the Congress taking a role in provincial government in the late 1930s. Gandhi and the Congress withdrew their support of the Raj when the Viceroy declared war on Germany in September 1939 without consultation. Tensions escalated until Gandhi demanded immediate independence in 1942 and the British responded by imprisoning him and tens of thousands of Congress leaders. Meanwhile, the Muslim League did co-operate with Britain and moved, against Gandhi's strong opposition, to demands for a totally separate Muslim state of Pakistan. In August 1947 the British partitioned the land with India and Pakistan each achieving independence on terms that Gandhi disapproved.</p>

According to some accounts, Gandhi died instantly.In other accounts, such as one prepared by an eyewitness journalist, Gandhi was carried into the Birla House, into a bedroom. There he died about 30 minutes later as one of Gandhi's family members read verses from Hindu scriptures.
